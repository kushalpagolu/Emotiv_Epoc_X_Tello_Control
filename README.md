# Emotiv_Epoc_X_Tello_Control
Project aims to control a Tello drone using real-time EEG data streamed from an Emotiv EPOC X headset.


## Project Overview

This project aims to control a Tello drone using real-time EEG data streamed from an Emotiv EPOC X headset. It utilizes an LSTM and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent trained with the PPO algorithm to translate EEG signals into drone control commands. The system includes modules for data streaming, preprocessing, visualization, drone control, and RL-based decision-making. The RL agent continuously learns and improves its control strategy over multiple sessions.


### The EMOTIV EPOC+ headset sends encrypted 32-byte data packets that decrypt to a structured array containing EEG readings, sensor data, and device status information. 


## Here's the breakdown of the decrypted data structure:

## Data Packet Structure

| **Index** | **Data Type** | **Description** | **Value Range** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| 0 | `uint8` | Packet counter | 0-127 (data packets), 128-255 (battery status) |
| 1-27 | `uint16[^14]` | 14 EEG channel values | 14-bit values (0-16383) |
| 28 | `int8` | Gyroscope X-axis | -127 to 127 |
| 29 | `int8` | Gyroscope Y-axis | -127 to 127 |
| 30-31 | Reserved | Checksum/padding | N/A |

### EEG Channel Details (Indices 1-27)

Each EEG channel is stored as a 14-bit value across two bytes with this mapping:

```python
# From [^2]
bit_indexes = {
    'F3': [10,11,12,13,14,15,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],
    'FC5': [28,29,30,31,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,8,9],
    # ... (similar mappings for other channels)
}
```

**Conversion to microvolts**:
\$ Microvolts = 0.51 \times raw\_value \$
This converts the 14-bit ADC reading to physical units.

### Special Fields

**Packet Counter (Index 0)**:

- Values 0-127: Normal data packet
- Values 128-255: Battery status packet
    - 128-225: 0% battery
    - 226-247: Linear scale (0-100%)
    - 248-255: 100% battery

**Gyroscope Data**:

- X-axis (Index 28): Horizontal head movement
- Y-axis (Index 29): Vertical head movement
- Scaled to ±127 = ±90 degrees


### Contact Quality System

The packet counter determines which electrode's contact quality is being reported:

```python
# From 
cq_order = ["F3", "FC5", "AF3", "F7", "T7", "P7", "O1", 
           "O2", "P8", "T8", "F8", "AF4", "FC6", "F4",
           "F8", "AF4", None*48, ...]
```

Quality values range 0-1 (0=poor, 1=excellent contact).

## Security Considerations

The decryption uses AES-ECB mode with a key derived from the device serial number:

```python
# Key generation from 
def generate_aes_key(serial, model):
    k = serial[-5:-3] + model[-2:] + serial[-4:-1]
    return k.ljust(16, '\0')[:16]
```

This predictable key generation and ECB mode usage create cryptographic vulnerabilities.



## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

1. **Hardware:**
    * Emotiv EPOC X headset
    * Tello drone
    * Computer with sufficient processing power
2. **Software:**
    * Python 3.7+
    * Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib hid djitellopy pycryptodome scikit-learn stable-baselines3 gym numpy, scipy, pywt, pynput                       
```


### Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone [<repository_url>] (https://github.com/kushalpagolu/Emotiv_Epoc_X_Tello_Control)
cd Emotiv_Epoc_X_Tello_Control
```

2. **Connect Hardware:**
    * Connect the Emotiv EPOC X headset to your computer.
    * Ensure the Tello drone is powered on and connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

### Running the Project

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

```bash
cd Emotiv_Epoc_X_Tello_Control
```

## Without connecting a drone run the project to see the predictions.
2. **Run `main.py`:**

```bash
python main.py
```


3. **Run `main.py` with drone connected:**

```bash
python main.py --connect-drone
```


### Testing the Project

1. **Initial Connection:**
    * The script will first attempt to connect to the Emotiv headset. Check the console output for the message "Emotiv EEG device connected." If the connection fails, ensure the headset is properly connected and the drivers are installed.
    * Next, the script will attempt to connect to the Tello drone. Check the console output for the message "Drone connected successfully"
2. **Real-time EEG Visualization:**
    * If the Emotiv headset is successfully connected, a Matplotlib window will appear, displaying the real-time EEG signals from the 14 channels and the head movement trajectory based on gyro data.
3. **Drone Control:**
    * After the drone connects, it should automatically take off. The RL agent will then start sending control commands to the drone based on the EEG data.
    * Observe the drone's behavior. Initially, the control might be erratic as the RL agent is still learning.
    * You can interrupt the script by pressing `Ctrl+C`. This will trigger the shutdown sequence, landing the drone and disconnecting from the devices.


### EEGProcessor class is designed to preprocess EEG data, extract meaningful features, and classify brain states using a Random Forest model for real-time drone control. Let's analyze the code in depth.


## File Structure and Descriptions

Here's a breakdown of the purpose of each file in the project:

* **`main.py`**: This is the main entry point of the application. It handles the overall program flow, device connections, thread management, and the main loop for data collection and processing.
* **`learning_rlagent.py`**: Defines the RL environment (`DroneControlEnv`) and manages the RL agent. It includes the logic for state updates, action execution, and model loading/creation.
* **`drone_control.py`**: Contains the `TelloController` class, which interfaces with the Tello drone via the `djitellopy` library. It provides methods for connecting to the drone, sending control commands (takeoff, land, movement), and setting speeds.
* **`visualizer_realtime.py`**: Implements the `RealtimeEEGVisualizer` class, responsible for displaying EEG data and gyro data in real-time using Matplotlib.
* **`stream_data.py`**: Includes the `EmotivStreamer` class, which handles the connection to the Emotiv EPOC X headset, decrypts the EEG data, and preprocesses it for use by the RL agent.
* **`kalman_filter.py`**: Contains a basic Kalman filter implementation (currently unused in the main loop) for potential noise reduction in sensor data.


## Execution Flow

1. **`main.py` Execution:**
    * The `main.py` script starts by setting up logging and defining a signal handler to ensure graceful shutdown on `Ctrl+C`.
    * It initializes instances of `EmotivStreamer`, `RealtimeEEGVisualizer`, and `KalmanFilter`.
    * It attempts to connect to the Emotiv headset using `EmotivStreamer.connect()`.
    * If the headset connection is successful, it attempts to connect to the Tello drone using `DroneControlEnv.connect_drone()`.
    * It starts a background thread (`save_thread`) to continuously save the collected EEG data to an Excel file using the `save_data_continuously` function.
    * It then calls the `start_data_collection` function, which contains the main data processing loop.
2. **Data Collection and Processing:**
    * The `start_data_collection` function defines a `data_generator` function that continuously reads data packets from the Emotiv headset using `EmotivStreamer.read_packet()`.
    * The `read_packet` function decrypts the EEG data, extracts sensor values (EEG, gyro, battery), and returns a dictionary containing this information.
    * Inside the `data_generator`, the EEG data and gyro data are fed to `RealtimeEEGVisualizer.update()`.
    * The `update` function updates the Matplotlib plots in real-time, displaying the EEG signals from each channel and the head movement trajectory based on gyro data.
3. **RL Agent and Drone Control (In `learning_rlagent.py`):**
    * The `DroneControlEnv` class defines the environment in which the RL agent learns to control the drone.
    * The `connect_drone` method attempts to connect to the Tello drone and sends a takeoff command.
    * The `step` method receives an action from the RL agent, translates it into drone control commands (forward/backward speed, left/right speed), and sends these commands to the drone using `TelloController.send_rc_control()`.
    * The `update_state` method updates the current state of the environment based on the incoming EEG data.
    * The `load_or_create_model` method loads a pre-trained PPO model or creates a new one if none exists.
    * The `train_step` method processes EEG data, updates the environment state, predicts an action using the RL model, and (optionally) allows for human intervention to override the agent's action.
4. **Threading:**
    * Data saving is handled in a separate background thread to prevent blocking the main data collection and visualization loop.
5. **Shutdown:**
    * The `signal_handler` function is called when the program receives a `Ctrl+C` signal. It sets the `stop_saving_thread` event to signal the data saving thread to stop, disconnects from the Emotiv headset, closes all Matplotlib plots, and exits the program.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Execution Flow (`main.py`)

```python
# Thread Management
stream_thread = threading.Thread(target=streaming_thread, ...)
preprocess_thread = threading.Thread(target=preprocessing_thread, ...)

# Queue Initialization
data_queue = queue.Queue()          # Raw EEG data pipeline

visualizer = RealtimeEEGVisualizer()# 3D brain visualization
env = DroneControlEnv(...)          # Drone control interface
```


### 2. Thread Responsibilities

**Streaming Thread:**

```python
def streaming_thread():
    while active:
        packet = emotiv.read_emotiv_data()  # Raw data acquisition
        data_queue.put(packet)              # Feed processing pipeline
        visualization_queue.put(packet)     # Update live visualization
        handle_gyro_data(packet)            # Track head movements
```

**Processing Thread:**

```python
def preprocessing_thread():
    while active:
        packet = data_queue.get()           # Retrieve raw data
        buffers = update_eeg_buffers()      # Maintain 10s window (256 samples @ 256Hz)
        feature_sequence = extract_features() # Compute 42+ features/channel
        lstm_output = predict_sequence()    # LSTM temporal analysis
        action = rl_agent.predict()         # Reinforcement learning decision
        env.step(action)                    # Execute drone command
```

    first_deriv = np.diff(signal)
    second_deriv = np.diff(first_deriv)
    return [
        np.sqrt(np.var(first_deriv)/np.var(signal)),  # Mobility
        np.sqrt(np.var(second_deriv)/np.var(first_deriv))  # Complexity
    ]
```


#### 🌌 Spectral Features

```python
def compute_band_power(eeg_data):
    fourier_transform = fft(eeg_fft) / buffer_size
    return {
        'delta': 1-4Hz,
        'theta': 4-8Hz,
        'alpha': 8-12Hz,
        'beta': 12-30Hz,
        'gamma': 30-45Hz
    }
```


#### 🌀 Nonlinear Features

```python
def higuchi_fractal_dimension(signal):
    L = []
    for k in 1..10:
        L.append(np.mean([sum(abs(diff(signal[m::k]))) for m in 0..k]))
    return -np.polyfit(log(k), log(L), 1)[^0]
```

### 5. Performance Considerations

1. **Timing Constraints** (256Hz sampling):
    - 3.9ms per sample window
    - 100ms maximum acceptable latency

2. **Memory Management:**

```python
Primary Buffer: 256 samples/channel (1s window)
Secondary Buffer: 2560 samples (10s history)
```

3. **Model Inference:**

```python
LSTM Input Shape: (10, 42)  # 10s window × 42 features
RL Agent Output: 6 actions  # (yaw, pitch, roll, altitude, x, y)
```




## Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Issues:**

1. **Empty Packet Flood:**

```python
if empty_packet_count &gt; 200:  # Auto-reconnect trigger
    emotiv.disconnect()
    time.sleep(3)
    emotiv.connect()
```

2. **Model Convergence Warnings:**

```python
except ConvergenceWarning:  # ICA non-convergence
    logger.warning("ICA failed to converge - using raw data")
```

3. **Visualization Latency:**

```python
anim_interval=100  # 100ms refresh rate
cache_frame_data=False  # Prevent memory bloat
```


This architecture enables real-time processing of EEG signals with 42+ features per channel while maintaining sub-100ms latency from brain signal to drone action. The queue-based threading model ensures stable operation even with variable sensor input rates.
